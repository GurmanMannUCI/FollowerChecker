# FollowerChecker

Requires Tweepy!

This program is used to look at the differences between your current list of followers and previous list of followers 
to determine which followers are new and which people unfollowed you. It prints out the username (the name after the '@' sign)
of each person thats in the two following groups. Since this compares a current list and a previous list, this program wont
be useful until you run it for the first time to set the first list of followers. 

--Main Requirements--
THe main requirements for this program are
- valid API keys(access token, consumer key, etc)
- Tweepy 
-Python 2.7
